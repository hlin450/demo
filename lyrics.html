    <h2 class="artist">By Luke Combs</h2>

    <p>
      Her day starts with a coffee <br />
      And ends with a wine <br />
      Takes forever gettin' ready <br />
      So she's never on time for anything <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes <br />
      Well, it kinda scares me <br />
      The way that she drives me wild <br />
      And she drives me wild <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Beautiful, crazy <br />
      She can't help but amaze me <br />
      The way that she dances <br />
      Ain't afraid to take chances <br />
      And wears her heart on her sleeve <br />
      Yeah, she's crazy <br />
      But her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      She makes plans for the weekend <br />
      Can't wait to go out <br />
      Till she changes her mind <br />
      And says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV" <br />
      And she falls asleep <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Beautiful, crazy <br />
      She can't help but amaze me <br />
      The way that she dances <br />
      Ain't afraid to take chances <br />
      Yeah, she's crazy <br />
      But her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      She's unpredictable, unforgettable <br />
      It's unusual, unbelievable <br />
      How I'm such a fool <br />
      Yeah, I'm such a fool for her <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Beautiful, crazy <br />
      She can't help but amaze me <br />
      The way that she dances <br />
      Ain't afraid to take chances <br />
      And wears her heart on her sleeve <br />
      Yeah, she's crazy <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      She's crazy <br />
      She's crazy <br />
      But her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
      Her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
    </p>
