    Beautiful Crazy
</h1>
<h2>
    Luke Combs
</h2>
    
<p>
Her day starts with a coffee <br />
And ends with a wine <br />
Takes forever gettin' ready <br />
So she's never on time for anything <br />
</p>

<p>
When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes <br />
Well, it kinda scares me <br />
The way that she drives me wild <br />
And she drives me wild <br />
</p>

<p>
Beautiful, crazy <br />
She can't help but amaze me <br />
The way that she dances <br />
Ain't afraid to take chances <br />
And wears her heart on her sleeve <br />
Yeah, she's crazy <br />
But her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
</p>

<p>
She makes plans for the weekend <br />
Can't wait to go out <br />
Till she changes her mind <br />
And says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV" <br />
And she falls asleep <br />
</p>

<p>
Beautiful, crazy <br />
She can't help but amaze me <br />
The way that she dances <br />
Ain't afraid to take chances <br />
Yeah, she's crazy <br />
But her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
</p>

<p>
She's unpredictable, unforgettable <br />
It's unusual, unbelievable <br />
How I'm such a fool <br />
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her <br />
</p>

<p>
Beautiful, crazy <br />
She can't help but amaze me <br />
The way that she dances <br />
Ain't afraid to take chances <br />
And wears her heart on her sleeve <br />
Yeah, she's crazy <br />
</p>

<p>
She's crazy <br />
She's crazy <br />
But her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
Her crazy's beautiful to me <br />
</p>
